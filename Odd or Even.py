#Code to find if the inputted number is an odd number or an even number
x = int(input("Enter a digit: "))

if (x % 2) == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")

#Another way to find if the numbers are odd or even
if (x/2) == int:
    print("this number is even")
else:
    print("this number is odd")
